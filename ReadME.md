#Process Execution Simulation
Input - Process Instructions 
      - Memory Data 

A simple processor simulator using a hypothetical machine. The processor contains a single data register, called an accumulator (AC). Both instructions and data are 16 bits long. Thus, it is convenient to organize memory using 16-bit words. The instruction format provides 4 bits for the opcode, so that there can be as many as 2 4 = 16 different opcodes, and up to 2 12 = 4096 (4K) words of memory can be directly addressed.
